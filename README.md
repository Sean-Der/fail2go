# fail2go

##Overview

fail2go abstracts away the communication with the fail2ban socket, allowing Go programs like fail2rest to just work with
Go data structures and not worry about serialization issues

##Contributing
Every PR will be merged! Feel free to open up PRs that aren't fully done, I will do
my best to finish them for you. I will make sure to review everything I can. If
you are interested in working on fail2go, but don't know where to start here are some ideas.

* Find unimplemented fail2ban-client commands
* Improve data assertions before json.marshall (this is really important!)
* Expand fail2ban-server so that we can perform more operations via socket. I would like to avoid editing files as long as possible
